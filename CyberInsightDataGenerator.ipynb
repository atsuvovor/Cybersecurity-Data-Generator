        "## Project Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This project provides a Python script designed to generate synthetic cybersecurity issue data. The goal is to create a realistic dataset that simulates both normal and anomalous cybersecurity events, which can be used for various purposes such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Training anomaly detection models:** The generated data includes labeled normal and anomalous samples.\n",
        "*   **Testing security information and event management (SIEM) systems:** The dataset mimics real-world security logs and incidents.\n",
        "*   **Developing and validating security analytics:** The diverse set of features allows for exploring various security metrics and indicators.\n",
        "*   **Demonstrating cybersecurity concepts:** The dataset can be used for educational purposes to illustrate different types of attacks and their characteristics.\n",
        "\n",
        "The script generates data with a variety of attributes, including issue details, user activity, system metrics, and threat indicators. It also incorporates a simple adaptive defense mechanism based on the calculated threat level and severity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Core Data Schema**:\n",
        "   Each column will be structured to simulate real-world attributes.  \n",
        "\n",
        "  \n",
        "   - `Issue ID`, `Issue Key`: Unique identifiers.\n",
        "   - `Issue Name`, `Category`, `Severity`: Descriptive issue metadata with categorical values.\n",
        "   - `Status`, `Reporters`, `Assignees`: Status categories and personnel involved.\n",
        "   - `Date Reported`, `Date Resolved`: Randomized dates across a timeline.\n",
        "   - `Impact Score`, `Risk Level`: Randomized scores to reflect varying severity.\n",
        "   - `Cost`: Randomized to reflect the volatility in month-over-month impact.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**User Activity Columns**:\n",
        "   Columns like `user_id`, `timestamp`, `activity_type`, `location`, `session_duration`, and `data_transfer_MB` will be generated to simulate behavioral patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Monthly Volatility**:  \n",
        "  - **Impact Score**, **Cost**, and **data_transfer_MB** We use synthetic techniques to create spikes or drops in activity between months, simulating the volatility in issues or user activity.\n",
        "  - For example, we use random walks to vary values in a non-linear fashion to capture realistic volatility.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Augmentation**:\n",
        "   - **Scaling Up Data Points**: We will use SMOTE or random sampling for categorical columns to add diversity.\n",
        "   - **Label Swapping for `Assignees`, `Departments`**: Here, we randomly reassign categories periodically to simulate changing roles.\n",
        "   - **Time-Series Variability**: We use simulated timestamps within and across sessions to show login attempts, data transfer spikes, and session durations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**User activity features:**  \n",
        "\n",
        "  - user_id: Identifier for each user.  \n",
        "  - timestamp: Time of the activity.  \n",
        "  - activity_type: Type of activity (e.g., \"login,\" \"file_access,\" \"data_modification\").  \n",
        "  - location: User's location (e.g., IP region).  \n",
        "  - session_duration: Length of session in seconds.  \n",
        "  - num_files_accessed: Number of files accessed in a session.  \n",
        "  - ogin_attempts: Number of login attempts in a session.  \n",
        "  - data_transfer_MB: Amount of data transferred (MB).  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Anomalies:**  \n",
        "\n",
        "  - We include some rows with anomalous patterns like high login attempts, unusual session duration and high data transfer volumes from unexpected locations\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explanation of Key Parts:**\n",
        "- **Volatile Data Generation**: The `generate_volatile_data` function adds random fluctuations to values, simulating high month-over-month volatility.\n",
        "- **User Activity Features**: Columns like `activity_type`, `session_duration`, `num_files_accessed`, `login_attempts`, and `data_transfer_MB` are varied to reflect real user behaviors.\n",
        "- **Random Timestamps**: Activity timestamps are spread across the timeline from `start_date` to `end_date`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Generate normal issues dataset**: First, we a normal issue dataset with almost no data anomaly\n",
        "- **Generate anomalous issues dataset**: The we introduce anomaly to the detaset\n",
        "- **Combine normal and anomalous data**: We combine both normal and anomalous datasets  \n",
        "- **Adressing class imbalance in datasets**:Using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) we make sure that class imbalance in the dataset is resolved.  \n",
        "all the data files are saves on google drive  \n",
        "\n",
        "  \n",
        "**User Activities Generation Metrics Formula**  \n",
        "\n",
        "The expression:  base_value + base_value * volatility * (np.random.randn()) * (1.2 if severity in ['High', 'Critical'] else 1)\n",
        "\n",
        "means that we’re generating a value based on a starting point (base_value) and adjusting it for both randomness and severity level. Here's a breakdown:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **base_value**: This is the initial value that the output is based on.\n",
        "- **volatility * (np.random.randn())**: This part adds a random fluctuation around the base_value. `np.random.randn()` generates a value from a standard normal distribution (centered around 0), so it could be positive or negative, creating variation. Multiplying by volatility scales the randomness, making the fluctuation stronger or weaker.\n",
        "- **(1.2 if severity in ['High', 'Critical'] else 1)**: This adds an additional factor to increase the outcome by 20% if the severity is \"High\" or \"Critical.\" If severity isn’t in these categories, the factor is simply 1, meaning no extra adjustment.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, if severity is \"High\" or \"Critical,\" the result is a base value adjusted for both volatility and severity; otherwise, it’s just the base value with volatility adjustment.  \n",

        "   - **Category**: Certain categories (e.g., unauthorized access) carry a higher base threat level.\n",
        "   - **Activity Type**: Suspicious activity types (e.g., high login attempts, data modification) indicate a greater threat.\n",
        "   - **Login Attempts**: Unusually high login attempts signal a brute force attack.\n",
